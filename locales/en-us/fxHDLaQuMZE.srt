1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,340
So there's lots of different ways you could have solved

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,880
this. You need to use the print command to print out

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,990
the result. And then we want an expression that calculates the

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:12,590
number of minutes in seven weeks. There's seven weeks, each week

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,930
has seven days, so we can have seven times seven for

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:18,910
the number of days. Then to get the number of minutes,

7
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,850
we need to multiply that by 24 to get the number

8
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:25,460
of hours And then multiply again, by 60. That should give

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:30,770
us the number of minutes. So let's see that in the Python interpreter. And now

10
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:36,704
we hit Run, and we see that we have 70,560 minutes. Seems

11
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:40,490
like a lot of time. It's going to go pretty quick, and we hope by

12
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:45,150
the end of the seven weeks, all of you will be accomplished Python programmers.
